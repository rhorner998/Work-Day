# Work-Day
This repository is for a time sensitive work day planner. It provides time blocks from the hours of 9am to 5pm with the option to save any notes made to the specific time blocks to local storage so that your notations will not be lost upon refreshing the page. The program also color codes the time blocks depending on whether they take place in the past, present or future (using day.js to keep track of the current time).
